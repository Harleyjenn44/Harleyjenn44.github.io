    <p>Hello! This is all about me! My name is Ashton and I was born and raised in Kansas City. I graduated from Sumner
        Academy of the Arts and Sciences. I originally wanted to become a pharmacist when I graduated from high school
        but found out that it wasn't the career for me. So here I am. I'm on my way to becoming a software engineer. I
        chose this as a career because my passion is volunteering for different non-profits. My favorite non-profit is
        To Write Love On Her Arms. They offer a lot a support for people struggling with addiction or mental health.
    </p>
    <p>For fun, I enjoy spending time with my friends and animals. I have two amazing best friends and one amazing
        boyfriend. My mom and they are my biggest supporters for this career.</p>
 
        <p>With this career, I hope to be able to help my community and be able to raise a family comfortably. I love
        computers and I'm a really quick learner. That is why I think I'll do great in this field and make a great
        career for me.</p>
